<p>Welcome! This guide is designed to help people with autism understand other health conditions they might also have. Each section includes <strong>what the condition is</strong>, <strong>how to recognize it</strong>, and <strong>what to do next</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>`"When you have met one person with autism, you have met one person with autism."`

<h2 id="condition-1-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd">‚ö° Condition 1: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</h2>
<p><img alt="ADHD" src="img/ADHD.png" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>ADHD is a condition that makes it hard to pay attention or sit still. People with ADHD often have <strong>inattention</strong> (daydreaming, forgetfulness) or <strong>hyperactivity</strong> (fidgeting, talking a lot). ADHD is common in autism. It means the brain‚Äôs attention and activity controls are different.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trouble staying focused:</strong> making careless mistakes, losing items, daydreaming.</li>
<li><strong>Restlessness:</strong> fidgeting hands/feet, can‚Äôt sit still.</li>
<li><strong>Impulsivity:</strong> blurting out answers, interrupting, acting without thinking.</li>
<li><strong>Forgetfulness and disorganization:</strong> hard to finish tasks or follow instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talk to a doctor:</strong> If these signs match you or someone you know, see a healthcare provider for an ADHD evaluation.</li>
<li><strong>Therapy and supports:</strong> Therapists can teach skills (behavior therapy, social skills training) and schools can offer help (extra time or breaks).</li>
<li><strong>Medication (if needed):</strong> A doctor may prescribe stimulants or other medicines to help focus, used carefully.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lifestyle habits:</strong> Keep a routine, use timers or organizers, get regular exercise, and ensure good sleep and a healthy diet. These healthy habits (fruits/veggies, exercise, enough sleep) can improve focus and mood.</p>
<p><code>Key Points: ADHD can make people with autism feel restless or forgetful. If you notice these signs, talk with a doctor 2 . Therapies, tools (like timers or fidget toys), and routines can help manage ADHD and make daily life easier.</code></p>

<h2 id="condition-2-anxiety-disorders">üò∞ Condition 2: Anxiety Disorders</h2>
<p><img alt="Anxiety Disorders" src="img/anxiety.png" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it_1">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>Anxiety disorders mean feeling <strong>extreme fear or worry</strong> that doesn‚Äôt go away. It‚Äôs more than being nervous before a test or event. For someone with autism, anxiety can show up as panic, social fears, or phobias. Anxiety disorders often co-occur with autism. By definition, anxiety becomes a disorder when ‚Äúanxiety does not go away, is felt in many situations, and can get worse over time‚Äù.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it_1">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Excessive worry or fear:</strong> Constant nervousness about school, friends, or everyday events.</li>
<li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Stomachaches, headaches, rapid heartbeat, sweating, or trembling when anxious.</li>
<li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> Trying to escape or avoid places, people, or situations (e.g. avoiding school or loud places).</li>
<li><strong>Restlessness or irritability:</strong> Trouble sleeping, seeming on-edge, or quick to get upset over small things.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps_1">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Talk to a healthcare provider:</strong> If anxiety interferes with life (school or social activities), discuss it with a doctor or psychologist. They can help diagnose anxiety disorders.</li>
<li><strong>Therapies:</strong> Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or counseling can teach coping skills (how to face fears step-by-step, relaxation techniques).</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle changes:</strong> Practice healthy routines ‚Äì regular exercise, a balanced diet, and enough sleep Parents can help by creating a calm, predictable routine and teaching simple relaxation (deep breathing).</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safe spaces and supports:</strong> Use noise-canceling headphones or quiet breaks when overwhelmed. Mindfulness, gentle yoga, or hobbies can reduce stress.</p>
<p><code>Key Points: Anxiety is common in autism and can look like constant worry or fear. If anxiety hurts daily life, talk with a doctor who may recommend therapy (like CBT) or strategies to help. Healthy habits (sleep, exercise) and gradual exposure (facing small fears step-by-step) also help.</code></p>

<p><img alt="Depression" src="img/depression.png" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it_2">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>Depression is more than feeling sad for a day. It means <strong>persistent sadness or loss of interest</strong> that lasts weeks and affects daily life. People with autism can feel depressed too. Depression can cause deep tiredness and hopeless feelings. The CDC describes signs such as ‚Äúfeeling sad or anxious often or all the time‚Äù and ‚Äúnot wanting to do activities that used to be fun‚Äù</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it_2">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Persistent sadness or irritability:</strong> Feeling down, empty, or easily frustrated most of the time.</li>
<li><strong>Loss of interest:</strong> No longer enjoying activities, friends, or games one used to like.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep and appetite changes:</strong> Sleeping too much or too little; eating much more or less than usual.</li>
<li><strong>Physical symptoms:</strong> Ongoing body aches, headaches, or stomachaches without a clear cause.</li>
<li><strong>Low energy and self-worth:</strong> Feeling tired all the time, worthless, or guilty. Difficulty concentrating or making decisions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps_2">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reach out for help:</strong> If someone feels this way for weeks, talk to a healthcare provider immediately. This is important especially if thoughts of self-harm occur.</li>
<li><strong>Therapy:</strong> A counselor or psychologist can offer talk therapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy) to help cope with feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Medication:</strong> A doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications if needed, often along with therapy.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle and routine:</strong> Keep a healthy schedule (regular meals, activity, sleep). Gentle exercise (walking, swimming) and time outdoors can lift mood. Make sure to include fun activities or hobbies as much as possible.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Support:</strong> Stay connected with friends/family. Sharing feelings with someone trusted can provide relief.</p>
<p><code>Key Points: Depression causes deep sadness or irritability that lasts a long time. Tell a doctor or counselor if you notice these signs 11 . Treatment (like talk therapy, support, healthy routines) can help you feel better. You deserve help and hope.</code></p>

<p><img alt="Sleep Disorders" src="img/sleep.png" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it_3">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>Sleep disorders are problems falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested. In autism, many have trouble sleeping or feeling sleepy during the day. According to the Mayo Clinic, sleep disorders ‚Äúchange the way you sleep‚Äù so you don‚Äôt get enough rest, leading to daytime tiredness.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it_3">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep:</strong> Lying awake for a long time at night, waking up often, or waking too early and unable to return to sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Daytime sleepiness:</strong> Feeling very sleepy in the day, even dozing off during meals or classes.</li>
<li><strong>Snoring or breathing pauses:</strong> Loud snoring, gasping, or choking sounds during sleep can signal sleep apnea.</li>
<li><strong>Restless legs/teeth grinding:</strong> If legs twitch or grind teeth at night, it can disturb sleep.</li>
<li><strong>Bed-wetting or sleepwalking:</strong> Unusual activities while asleep may occur in some sleep disorders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps_3">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good sleep habits:</strong> Establish a quiet, dark bedtime routine. Go to bed and wake up at the same times each day. Avoid screens and caffeine (like soda) in the evening.</li>
<li><strong>Bedroom environment:</strong> Make the bedroom comfortable and calm (cool temperature, comfortable mattress). For sensory issues, consider a weighted blanket or white noise.</li>
<li><strong>Talk to a doctor:</strong> If problems continue, discuss with a pediatrician or sleep specialist. They may check for conditions like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Possible treatments:</strong> Doctors may recommend melatonin (a sleep supplement), breathing devices (CPAP) for apnea, or special exercises.</p>
<p><code>Key Points: Good sleep is vital. If you or your child often feel tired, have trouble sleeping, or snore loudly, talk to a doctor. Lifestyle fixes (bedtime routine, limit screens) can help, and medical treatment may be needed to restore healthy sleep.</code></p>

<p><img alt="Gastrointestinal (GI) Issues" src="img/gastro.png" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it_4">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>GI issues include stomach and digestive problems like <strong>abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea</strong>. These are very common in autism. Mayo Clinic notes that children with autism ‚Äútend to have more medical issues, including gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhea‚Äù.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it_4">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tummy pain or cramps:</strong> Complaints of stomach ache, especially after eating.</li>
<li><strong>Constipation or diarrhea:</strong> Irregular or painful bowel movements. (Constipation often means hard stools infrequently; diarrhea is loose, frequent stools.)</li>
<li><strong>Other signs:</strong> Vomiting, gas/bloating, reflux (heartburn or throwing up after eating). Changes in appetite or unexplained weight loss/gain may occur.</li>
<li><strong>Behavioral clues:</strong> In younger/nonverbal people, watch for irritability or clutching belly, which may signal pain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps_4">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>See a doctor:</strong> Tell your pediatrician or GI specialist about symptoms. They may ask about diet, keep a food diary, or run tests (like checking iron levels or celiac disease) to find causes.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary changes:</strong> Increase fiber with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink plenty of water (especially with constipation). Identify and avoid any foods that trigger symptoms. A dietitian can help plan meals that are varied and nutritious.</li>
<li><strong>Routine:</strong> Encourage regular meal and bathroom times. Gentle exercise (walking, stretching) can stimulate digestion.</li>
<li><strong>Medications or therapies:</strong> Doctors may suggest stool softeners or laxatives for constipation, or acid-reducers for reflux. Probiotics (good bacteria) sometimes help upset stomachs.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nutrient check:</strong> Ensure a balanced diet or supplements if picky eating limits nutrition (see Nutritional Deficiencies section).</p>
<p><code>Key Points: Stomach issues often go hand-in-hand with autism. If someone has belly pain, constipation, or other GI symptoms, talk to a doctor. Small diet changes, hydration, and medical advice can help your digestion improve and make eating more comfortable.</code></p>

<p><img alt="Seizure Disorders" src="img/seizure.png" /></p>
<h3 id="what-is-it_5">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>Seizure disorders mean the brain has sudden bursts of electrical activity causing unusual behaviors. A <strong>seizure</strong> can look like staring blankly, jerking movements, or muscle stiffness. Not all seizures are epilepsy (more below), but any unexplained seizure should be checked.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it_5">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convulsions:</strong> Jerking or twitching of arms and legs. The person may fall or slump.</li>
<li><strong>Staring spells:</strong> Suddenly stopping and staring into space for a few seconds (often mistaken for daydreaming).</li>
<li><strong>Unresponsiveness:</strong> Not reacting to people or sound during the episode.</li>
<li><strong>Other signs:</strong> Strange sensations or feelings (aura) just before a seizure (like a funny taste, smell, or feeling of fear).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps_5">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay safe during seizures:</strong> For someone having a convulsive seizure, gently protect their head, remove sharp objects, and roll them on their side to keep airway clear. Don‚Äôt put anything in their mouth.</li>
<li><strong>Medical evaluation:</strong> If any seizure occurs, even once, see a doctor right away. They may do EEG brain tests or MRI to find causes.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnosis:</strong> Two or more unprovoked seizures usually means a diagnosis of epilepsy.</li>
<li><strong>Treatment:</strong> A neurologist may prescribe anti-seizure medication, which can prevent or reduce seizures in most people. Follow the medication plan carefully.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare:</strong> If epilepsy is diagnosed, work with the doctor to create a safety plan (e.g. avoid swimming alone, use helmets for high-risk activities).</p>
<p><code>Key Points: Seizures are caused by unusual brain activity. After any seizure, talk to a doctor for evaluation. Treatments (like medication) often control seizures 19 . People with autism who have seizures may also benefit from therapies and supports just like anyone with epilepsy.</code></p>

<h2 id="condition-7-sensory-processing-disorder-spd">üëÇ Condition 7: Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD)</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-it_6">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>Sensory Processing Disorder means the brain has trouble handling sensory information (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, balance, body awareness). Many autistic people experience it as <strong>over-sensitivity</strong> or <strong>under-sensitivity</strong> to things like lights, sounds, textures, or tastes.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it_6">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Over-responsiveness (hypersensitivity):</strong> Covers ears or cries at loud sounds; avoids bright lights or busy places; refuses certain clothing textures; gags at many smells or tastes.</li>
<li><strong>Under-responsiveness (hyposensitivity):</strong> Seeks strong sensations, like spinning or rocking a lot; seems unaware of pain or temperature; eats only very spicy or very bland foods; likes to touch everything.</li>
<li><strong>Movement issues:</strong> Bumps into things or often loses balance (vestibular sense), or difficulty knowing where limbs are (proprioception).</li>
<li><strong>Emotional signs:</strong> Easily overwhelmed or ‚Äúmelts down‚Äù in sensory-rich environments; may cover eyes/ears or panic.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps_6">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Occupational therapy:</strong> A trained OT can assess sensory needs and teach coping strategies or provide a ‚Äúsensory diet‚Äù (daily activities like swinging, bouncing, or fidget tools to help self-regulate).</li>
<li><strong>Home adaptations:</strong> Use noise-canceling headphones or sunglasses for loud/bright places. Let a child have quiet breaks in a calm space when needed.</li>
<li><strong>Routine &amp; structure:</strong> Plan for sensory breaks during the day (e.g. a walk, squeeze breaks).</li>
<li><strong>Tools:</strong> Weighted blankets, chewable jewelry, or fidget toys can help provide comforting sensory input.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> Teach the person to signal when something is too much (like a card or sign) so others can help reduce the stimulus.</p>
<p><code>Key Points: Sensory issues mean normal sights/sounds/feelings may feel too strong or too weak. For example, loud noises or scratchy clothes can upset someone with autism. Strategies like headphones, calming exercises, and therapy can help balance the sensory system and reduce overload.</code></p>

<h3 id="what-is-it_9">üîç What is it?</h3>
<p>TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes <strong>benign tumors</strong> (noncancerous growths) to form in many organs of the body. These growths, called tubers, most often appear in the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs. TSC symptoms vary by where tumors grow.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-recognize-it_9">üëÅÔ∏è How to recognize it:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skin findings:</strong> Common early sign is pale ‚Äúash leaf‚Äù spots on the skin. Other skin signs include red bumps on the face or bumps under the nails (fibromas).</li>
<li><strong>Seizures:</strong> Many with TSC have seizures (often in infancy) because brain tubers disrupt neural activity.</li>
<li><strong>Developmental issues:</strong> Learning disabilities, developmental delays, or autism/ADHD traits often occur.</li>
<li><strong>Kidney problems:</strong> Tumors or cysts in kidneys can cause pain or blood in urine (doctors will check kidneys with ultrasound).</li>
<li><strong>Heart/other:</strong> In infants, heart tumors may cause a heart murmur. TSC tumors can also affect lungs or eyes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps_9">üìå Next steps:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specialist care:</strong> If TSC is suspected, see a geneticist or neurologist. They will do imaging tests (MRI of brain/heart, ultrasounds of kidneys/lungs) to identify tumors.</li>
<li><strong>Treatments:</strong> Anti-seizure medications can help control seizures. Some tumors respond to medication (mTOR inhibitors) or surgery if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Regular check-ups:</strong> Lifelong monitoring is important. Follow-up with specialists to watch for changes in tumors, kidney function, heart health, and development.</li>
<li><strong>Therapies:</strong> Early intervention for developmental delays (speech, educational support) is helpful. Behavioral therapies address autism/ADHD if present.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Family counseling:</strong> Genetic counseling is important, since TSC is inherited. Families can learn about risks and management.</p>
<p><code>Key Points: Tuberous sclerosis causes growths in many organs (brain, skin, kidneys). It often leads to seizures and developmental delays. Comprehensive care (neurologist, kidney doctor, etc.) is needed: treat seizures, monitor tumors, and provide therapies so the person can stay as healthy as possible.</code></p>

<li><strong>Medical evaluation:</strong> Consult a doctor to rule out other conditions that may be causing symptoms. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests (such as electrocardiogram, blood tests, or tilt table test) can help diagnose POTS.</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle modifications:</strong> Increase salt and fluid intake to help regulate blood volume and blood pressure. Avoid standing for long periods, and take regular breaks to rest and hydrate.</li>
<li><strong>Medications:</strong> Beta blockers, fludrocortisone, or midodrine may be prescribed to help regulate heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Physical therapy:</strong> Gentle exercises, such as yoga or stretching, can help improve orthostatic tolerance and reduce symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Dietary changes:</strong> Eat small, frequent meals to avoid postprandial orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Avoid triggers like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Autonomic nervous system training:</strong> Techniques like heart rate variability training, biofeedback, or meditation can help regulate the autonomic nervous system and reduce POTS symptoms.</p>
<p><code>Key Points: POTS is a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system, leading to rapid heart rate, dizziness, and fatigue upon standing. Individuals with autism are at a higher risk of developing POTS. A comprehensive medical evaluation, lifestyle modifications, and medications can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.</code></p>
