Try the one in the video below. Your browser does not support the video tag. Welcome to the Forest Walk Meditation Welcome to this forest walk meditation, where you can take a few moments to breathe, relax, and connect with nature. Find a comfortable and quiet space to sit or lie down, and take a deep breath in through your nose and out through your mouth. Imagining the Forest Imagine yourself standing at the edge of a forest, surrounded by tall trees that stretch up towards the sky. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the feeling of the air on your skin. Take a deep breath in, and smell the scent of the trees and the earth. Walking into the Forest As you begin to walk into the forest, notice the sounds around you. Listen to the birds singing, the rustling of leaves, and the gentle breeze moving through the trees. Allow these sounds to wash over you, and feel your body begin to relax. Grounding and Centering Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground with each step. Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly, and the connection to the earth beneath you. With each step, allow yourself to feel more grounded and centered. Focusing on the Breath As you walk, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and the rise and fall of your chest. Allow your breath to become slow and deep, and feel your body begin to calm. Releasing Anxiety and Stress Now, imagine that with each step, you are leaving behind any feelings of anxiety, stress, or overwhelm. Allow these feelings to drop away, like leaves falling from the trees. With each step, feel yourself becoming more calm, more centered, and more regulated. Feeling the Sun's Warmth As you continue to walk, notice the sensation of the sun on your skin. Feel its warmth and gentle touch, and allow it to soothe any areas of tension or discomfort. Imagine that the sun's warmth is filling your body, and helping you to feel more relaxed and at ease. Safety and Support Remember, you are safe and supported in this forest. Allow yourself to let go of any worries or concerns, and simply be present in this moment. Take a deep breath in, and feel your body fill with calm and relaxation. The Clearing As you come to a clearing, notice the sensation of the space around you. Feel the openness and freedom, and allow yourself to expand and relax. Imagine that you are a part of this forest, connected to the trees, the earth, and the sky. Conclusion Take a few more deep breaths, and allow yourself to settle into this feeling of calm and regulation. Remember that you can return to this forest whenever you need to, and that it will always be here to support and comfort you. Returning to the Present When you are ready, slowly begin to bring your attention back to your physical body. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the feeling of the air on your skin. Take a deep breath in, and slowly open your eyes. Remember to take this feeling of calm and regulation with you, and to return to it whenever you need to.
