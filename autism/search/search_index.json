Try herbal teas or seltzer if plain water is hard to drink Fiber: For Regular Bowel Movements What it does: Helps prevent constipation and feeds good gut bacteria. Daily goal: 25-30g of fiber. Fiber-rich foods: Fruits (berries, pears, apples with skin) Vegetables (broccoli, carrots, leafy greens) Whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa) Beans, lentils, and seeds (chia, flaxseed) Go slow: Increase fiber gradually and drink more water. Healthy Fats: Calm the Gut & Brain Why they help: Support brain and gut function, reduce inflammation. Sources: Avocados Olive Oil Fatty Fish (salmon, sardines) Nuts & seeds (Walnuts, flax, chia) Magnesium: Soothing Mineral for Gut & Mood Why it helps: Can ease constipation, support relaxation, and reduce anxiety. Sources: Pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews Spinach, black beans Whole grains (brown rice, oatmeal) Supplements: Magnesium citrate is gentle on the stomach and may relieve constipation - check with Registered Dietitian or Doctor first. Vitamin C: Antioxidant & Gentle Support Why it helps: Supports the immune and may ease mild constipation. Sources: Oranges, strawberries, kiwi Bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli Supplements: Powders or chewables are easy options, ask your Registered Dietitian or Doctor about your best dose. Supplements to Consider for Gut Support Check with your healthcare provider before starting any supplement. These can be helpful for many autistic adults with sensitive GI systems: Probiotics What they do: Add \"good\" bacteria to support gut balance. Tips: Choose multi-strain formulas. Yogurt and kefir also contain live cultures. Aloe Vera Juice What it may help with: Mild constipation, gut inflammation, and soothing the digestive lining. Tip: Look for decolorized, purified aloe vera juice (without aloin). Start with a small amount (1-2 oz/day). Digestive Enzymes What they do: Help break down food more effectively and reduce bloating or discomfort. When to use: Take with meals, especially if you notice symptoms after eating certain foods (like dairy, gluten, or high-fat meals). Final Tips Routine helps: Try eating meals at the same time each day. Textures matter: Choose foods that feel comfortable to eat. Start small: Add one new habit at a time. Track symptoms: Keep a food and gut journal if helpful. When to Get Help If you're having ongoing stomach pain, constipation, or discomfort, talk to a doctor or registered dietitian for personalized support.
