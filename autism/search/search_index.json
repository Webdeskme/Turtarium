This guide is designed to help people with autism understand other health conditions they might also have. Each section includes what the condition is , how to recognize it , and what to do next . `\"When you have met one person with autism, you have met one person with autism.\"` \u2705 Note: Always talk to a doctor or healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis. \u26a1 Condition 1: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \ud83d\udd0d What is it? ADHD is a condition that makes it hard to pay attention or sit still. People with ADHD often have inattention (daydreaming, forgetfulness) or hyperactivity (fidgeting, talking a lot). ADHD is common in autism. It means the brain\u2019s attention and activity controls are different. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Trouble staying focused: making careless mistakes, losing items, daydreaming. Restlessness: fidgeting hands/feet, can\u2019t sit still. Impulsivity: blurting out answers, interrupting, acting without thinking. Forgetfulness and disorganization: hard to finish tasks or follow instructions. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Talk to a doctor: If these signs match you or someone you know, see a healthcare provider for an ADHD evaluation. Therapy and supports: Therapists can teach skills (behavior therapy, social skills training) and schools can offer help (extra time or breaks). Medication (if needed): A doctor may prescribe stimulants or other medicines to help focus, used carefully. Lifestyle habits: Keep a routine, use timers or organizers, get regular exercise, and ensure good sleep and a healthy diet. These healthy habits (fruits/veggies, exercise, enough sleep) can improve focus and mood. Key Points: ADHD can make people with autism feel restless or forgetful. If you notice these signs, talk with a doctor 2 . Therapies, tools (like timers or fidget toys), and routines can help manage ADHD and make daily life easier. \ud83d\udd17 Learn more from CHADD (Children and Adults with ADHD) \ud83d\udcca Fun Fact: Up to 70% of people with autism also have ADHD! \ud83d\ude30 Condition 2: Anxiety Disorders \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Anxiety disorders mean feeling extreme fear or worry that doesn\u2019t go away. It\u2019s more than being nervous before a test or event. For someone with autism, anxiety can show up as panic, social fears, or phobias. Anxiety disorders often co-occur with autism. By definition, anxiety becomes a disorder when \u201canxiety does not go away, is felt in many situations, and can get worse over time\u201d. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Excessive worry or fear: Constant nervousness about school, friends, or everyday events. Physical symptoms: Stomachaches, headaches, rapid heartbeat, sweating, or trembling when anxious. Avoidance: Trying to escape or avoid places, people, or situations (e.g. avoiding school or loud places). Restlessness or irritability: Trouble sleeping, seeming on-edge, or quick to get upset over small things. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Talk to a healthcare provider: If anxiety interferes with life (school or social activities), discuss it with a doctor or psychologist. They can help diagnose anxiety disorders. Therapies: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or counseling can teach coping skills (how to face fears step-by-step, relaxation techniques). Lifestyle changes: Practice healthy routines \u2013 regular exercise, a balanced diet, and enough sleep Parents can help by creating a calm, predictable routine and teaching simple relaxation (deep breathing). Safe spaces and supports: Use noise-canceling headphones or quiet breaks when overwhelmed. Mindfulness, gentle yoga, or hobbies can reduce stress. Key Points: Anxiety is common in autism and can look like constant worry or fear. If anxiety hurts daily life, talk with a doctor who may recommend therapy (like CBT) or strategies to help. Healthy habits (sleep, exercise) and gradual exposure (facing small fears step-by-step) also help. \ud83d\udd17 Learn more from the Anxiety & Depression Association of America \ud83d\ude14 Condition 3: Depression \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Depression is more than feeling sad for a day. It means persistent sadness or loss of interest that lasts weeks and affects daily life. People with autism can feel depressed too. Depression can cause deep tiredness and hopeless feelings. The CDC describes signs such as \u201cfeeling sad or anxious often or all the time\u201d and \u201cnot wanting to do activities that used to be fun\u201d \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Persistent sadness or irritability: Feeling down, empty, or easily frustrated most of the time. Loss of interest: No longer enjoying activities, friends, or games one used to like. Sleep and appetite changes: Sleeping too much or too little; eating much more or less than usual. Physical symptoms: Ongoing body aches, headaches, or stomachaches without a clear cause. Low energy and self-worth: Feeling tired all the time, worthless, or guilty. Difficulty concentrating or making decisions. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Reach out for help: If someone feels this way for weeks, talk to a healthcare provider immediately. This is important especially if thoughts of self-harm occur. Therapy: A counselor or psychologist can offer talk therapy (such as cognitive-behavioral therapy) to help cope with feelings. Medication: A doctor may prescribe antidepressant medications if needed, often along with therapy. Lifestyle and routine: Keep a healthy schedule (regular meals, activity, sleep). Gentle exercise (walking, swimming) and time outdoors can lift mood. Make sure to include fun activities or hobbies as much as possible. Support: Stay connected with friends/family. Sharing feelings with someone trusted can provide relief. Key Points: Depression causes deep sadness or irritability that lasts a long time. Tell a doctor or counselor if you notice these signs 11 . Treatment (like talk therapy, support, healthy routines) can help you feel better. You deserve help and hope. \ud83d\udd17 Learn more from the National Institute of Mental Health \ud83d\ude34 Condition 4: Sleep Disorders \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Sleep disorders are problems falling asleep, staying asleep, or feeling rested. In autism, many have trouble sleeping or feeling sleepy during the day. According to the Mayo Clinic, sleep disorders \u201cchange the way you sleep\u201d so you don\u2019t get enough rest, leading to daytime tiredness. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep: Lying awake for a long time at night, waking up often, or waking too early and unable to return to sleep. Daytime sleepiness: Feeling very sleepy in the day, even dozing off during meals or classes. Snoring or breathing pauses: Loud snoring, gasping, or choking sounds during sleep can signal sleep apnea. Restless legs/teeth grinding: If legs twitch or grind teeth at night, it can disturb sleep. Bed-wetting or sleepwalking: Unusual activities while asleep may occur in some sleep disorders. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Good sleep habits: Establish a quiet, dark bedtime routine. Go to bed and wake up at the same times each day. Avoid screens and caffeine (like soda) in the evening. Bedroom environment: Make the bedroom comfortable and calm (cool temperature, comfortable mattress). For sensory issues, consider a weighted blanket or white noise. Talk to a doctor: If problems continue, discuss with a pediatrician or sleep specialist. They may check for conditions like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome. Possible treatments: Doctors may recommend melatonin (a sleep supplement), breathing devices (CPAP) for apnea, or special exercises. Key Points: Good sleep is vital. If you or your child often feel tired, have trouble sleeping, or snore loudly, talk to a doctor. Lifestyle fixes (bedtime routine, limit screens) can help, and medical treatment may be needed to restore healthy sleep. \ud83d\udd17 Learn more from Sleep Foundation \ud83c\udf7d\ufe0f Condition 5: Gastrointestinal (GI) Issues \ud83d\udd0d What is it? GI issues include stomach and digestive problems like abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea . These are very common in autism. Mayo Clinic notes that children with autism \u201ctend to have more medical issues, including gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhea\u201d. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Tummy pain or cramps: Complaints of stomach ache, especially after eating. Constipation or diarrhea: Irregular or painful bowel movements. (Constipation often means hard stools infrequently; diarrhea is loose, frequent stools.) Other signs: Vomiting, gas/bloating, reflux (heartburn or throwing up after eating). Changes in appetite or unexplained weight loss/gain may occur. Behavioral clues: In younger/nonverbal people, watch for irritability or clutching belly, which may signal pain. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: See a doctor: Tell your pediatrician or GI specialist about symptoms. They may ask about diet, keep a food diary, or run tests (like checking iron levels or celiac disease) to find causes. Dietary changes: Increase fiber with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink plenty of water (especially with constipation). Identify and avoid any foods that trigger symptoms. A dietitian can help plan meals that are varied and nutritious. Routine: Encourage regular meal and bathroom times. Gentle exercise (walking, stretching) can stimulate digestion. Medications or therapies: Doctors may suggest stool softeners or laxatives for constipation, or acid-reducers for reflux. Probiotics (good bacteria) sometimes help upset stomachs. Nutrient check: Ensure a balanced diet or supplements if picky eating limits nutrition (see Nutritional Deficiencies section). Key Points: Stomach issues often go hand-in-hand with autism. If someone has belly pain, constipation, or other GI symptoms, talk to a doctor. Small diet changes, hydration, and medical advice can help your digestion improve and make eating more comfortable. \ud83d\udd17 Learn more from Autism Speaks \u26a1 Condition 6: Seizure Disorders \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Seizure disorders mean the brain has sudden bursts of electrical activity causing unusual behaviors. A seizure can look like staring blankly, jerking movements, or muscle stiffness. Not all seizures are epilepsy (more below), but any unexplained seizure should be checked. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Convulsions: Jerking or twitching of arms and legs. The person may fall or slump. Staring spells: Suddenly stopping and staring into space for a few seconds (often mistaken for daydreaming). Unresponsiveness: Not reacting to people or sound during the episode. Other signs: Strange sensations or feelings (aura) just before a seizure (like a funny taste, smell, or feeling of fear). \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Stay safe during seizures: For someone having a convulsive seizure, gently protect their head, remove sharp objects, and roll them on their side to keep airway clear. Don\u2019t put anything in their mouth. Medical evaluation: If any seizure occurs, even once, see a doctor right away. They may do EEG brain tests or MRI to find causes. Diagnosis: Two or more unprovoked seizures usually means a diagnosis of epilepsy. Treatment: A neurologist may prescribe anti-seizure medication, which can prevent or reduce seizures in most people. Follow the medication plan carefully. Prepare: If epilepsy is diagnosed, work with the doctor to create a safety plan (e.g. avoid swimming alone, use helmets for high-risk activities). Key Points: Seizures are caused by unusual brain activity. After any seizure, talk to a doctor for evaluation. Treatments (like medication) often control seizures 19 . People with autism who have seizures may also benefit from therapies and supports just like anyone with epilepsy. \ud83d\udd17 Epilepsy Foundation Resources \ud83d\udc42 Condition 7: Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Sensory Processing Disorder means the brain has trouble handling sensory information (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, balance, body awareness). Many autistic people experience it as over-sensitivity or under-sensitivity to things like lights, sounds, textures, or tastes. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Over-responsiveness (hypersensitivity): Covers ears or cries at loud sounds; avoids bright lights or busy places; refuses certain clothing textures; gags at many smells or tastes. Under-responsiveness (hyposensitivity): Seeks strong sensations, like spinning or rocking a lot; seems unaware of pain or temperature; eats only very spicy or very bland foods; likes to touch everything. Movement issues: Bumps into things or often loses balance (vestibular sense), or difficulty knowing where limbs are (proprioception). Emotional signs: Easily overwhelmed or \u201cmelts down\u201d in sensory-rich environments; may cover eyes/ears or panic. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Occupational therapy: A trained OT can assess sensory needs and teach coping strategies or provide a \u201csensory diet\u201d (daily activities like swinging, bouncing, or fidget tools to help self-regulate). Home adaptations: Use noise-canceling headphones or sunglasses for loud/bright places. Let a child have quiet breaks in a calm space when needed. Routine & structure: Plan for sensory breaks during the day (e.g. a walk, squeeze breaks). Tools: Weighted blankets, chewable jewelry, or fidget toys can help provide comforting sensory input. Communication: Teach the person to signal when something is too much (like a card or sign) so others can help reduce the stimulus. Key Points: Sensory issues mean normal sights/sounds/feelings may feel too strong or too weak. For example, loud noises or scratchy clothes can upset someone with autism. Strategies like headphones, calming exercises, and therapy can help balance the sensory system and reduce overload. \ud83d\udd17 STAR Institute for Sensory Processing \ud83e\udde0 Condition 8: Intellectual Disability \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Intellectual Disability is when a person\u2019s learning and daily skills develop more slowly than typical. It means limitations in learning, reasoning, and everyday functioning . As the CDC explains, \u201cIntellectual disability is a term used when there are limits to a person\u2019s ability to learn at an expected level and function in daily life\u201d. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Developmental delays: Sitting up, crawling, walking, and talking later than most children of the same age. Learning difficulties: Trouble remembering, understanding, or applying information. Learning new skills (like dressing or using the bathroom) may take more time. Communication and social skills: May speak later or have limited speech. Difficulty understanding social rules or reading social cues (like knowing personal space or tone of voice). Problem-solving challenges: Hard to figure out problems, plan steps to do something, or see consequences of actions. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Early evaluation: Talk with your doctor or pediatrician if you notice delays. They can refer you to specialists (developmental pediatrician, neurologist, or psychologist) for testing. Early evaluation leads to early support. Educational support: Children may qualify for early intervention or special education programs to learn skills. Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) in school can provide extra help. Therapies: Speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy can improve communication, daily living, and motor skills. Daily life strategies: Use simple, clear instructions and routines. Break tasks into small steps. Praise successes and provide positive support. Family support: Join support groups or seek resources (CDC\u2019s Parent Center) to help learn strategies and resources. Key Points: Intellectual disability means learning and daily skills develop more slowly. If a child misses milestones or struggles in school, consult a doctor or early intervention for testing and support. Therapies and special education can help the child reach their full potential. \ud83d\udd17 CDC - Intellectual Disability \ud83e\uddec Condition 9: Fragile X Syndrome \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Fragile X is a genetic condition and one of the most common inherited causes of autism and intellectual disability. It is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. People with Fragile X often have developmental delays and behavior differences. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Learning/developmental issues: Many have delayed speech, learning disabilities, or intellectual disability. They may struggle academically. Behavioral features: Anxiety, ADHD symptoms, or autism-like behaviors (hand-flapping, rocking) are common. Children may avoid eye contact or be socially shy. Physical traits: Some have a long, narrow face, large ears, and flexible joints. In boys, testes can be larger after puberty. Sensory issues: Often sensitive to sound, lights, or clothing texture. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Genetic testing and counseling: A doctor can confirm Fragile X with a blood test. Families often see a genetics specialist for diagnosis and family planning advice. Therapy: Early intervention programs (speech, occupational, behavioral therapy) can help with development and communication. Specialized education is beneficial. Medical treatments: Medications may help specific symptoms \u2013 e.g. stimulants for ADHD, SSRIs for anxiety, or anticonvulsants if seizures occur. Discuss options with a doctor. Support: Provide a structured routine and clear expectations. Use visual aids for learning (charts, pictures) as recommended by experts. Family resources: Connect with Fragile X support organizations. They offer guidance on therapies and supports. Key Points: Fragile X causes learning delays and sometimes autism-like behavior. A genetic test can confirm it. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms with therapies (speech, behavior) and, when needed, medications. Early support helps children with Fragile X thrive. \ud83d\udd17 FRAXA Research Foundation \ud83e\uddec Condition 10: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) \ud83d\udd0d What is it? TSC is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign tumors (noncancerous growths) to form in many organs of the body. These growths, called tubers, most often appear in the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, and lungs. TSC symptoms vary by where tumors grow. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Skin findings: Common early sign is pale \u201cash leaf\u201d spots on the skin. Other skin signs include red bumps on the face or bumps under the nails (fibromas). Seizures: Many with TSC have seizures (often in infancy) because brain tubers disrupt neural activity. Developmental issues: Learning disabilities, developmental delays, or autism/ADHD traits often occur. Kidney problems: Tumors or cysts in kidneys can cause pain or blood in urine (doctors will check kidneys with ultrasound). Heart/other: In infants, heart tumors may cause a heart murmur. TSC tumors can also affect lungs or eyes. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Specialist care: If TSC is suspected, see a geneticist or neurologist. They will do imaging tests (MRI of brain/heart, ultrasounds of kidneys/lungs) to identify tumors. Treatments: Anti-seizure medications can help control seizures. Some tumors respond to medication (mTOR inhibitors) or surgery if needed. Regular check-ups: Lifelong monitoring is important. Follow-up with specialists to watch for changes in tumors, kidney function, heart health, and development. Therapies: Early intervention for developmental delays (speech, educational support) is helpful. Behavioral therapies address autism/ADHD if present. Family counseling: Genetic counseling is important, since TSC is inherited. Families can learn about risks and management. Key Points: Tuberous sclerosis causes growths in many organs (brain, skin, kidneys). It often leads to seizures and developmental delays. Comprehensive care (neurologist, kidney doctor, etc.) is needed: treat seizures, monitor tumors, and provide therapies so the person can stay as healthy as possible. \ud83d\udd17 Tuberous Sclerosis Alliance \u26a1 Condition 11: Epilepsy \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Epilepsy is a brain condition that causes recurrent seizures . One seizure does not mean epilepsy; epilepsy is diagnosed when a person has two or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures in epilepsy can look like convulsions or staring spells. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Varied seizure types: Some seizures cause jerking movements (convulsions), while others cause staring spells or brief unresponsiveness. Loss of consciousness: The person may pass out or not respond for a short time. Warning signs (auras): Some feel something odd before a seizure, like a funny smell, taste, feeling of fear, or visual changes. Repetitive behaviors: Lip-smacking, hand movements, or confusion during or after a seizure are possible. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: See a neurologist: Diagnosis is typically made by a neurologist. They may use EEG brain wave tests or brain imaging (MRI) to study the seizures. Medication: Most people with epilepsy take anti-seizure medication. As Mayo Clinic notes, \u201cTreatment with medicines ... can control seizures for most people\u201d. Take medicines exactly as prescribed. Safety measures: Make sure to stay safe during seizures (padded crib rails for children, supervision around water). Discuss driving and activities based on seizure control. Lifestyle: Regular sleep and stress reduction can help reduce seizures. Keep a seizure diary to track triggers and medication effects. Support: Education plans (504 plans) at school can provide rest breaks or medical alert plans. Seizure response training for family/teachers is also recommended. Key Points: Epilepsy is diagnosed when seizures happen repeatedly. It\u2019s managed with medication and safety plans. With treatment, many people with epilepsy live full lives. Remember, talk to the doctor about seizures and follow their treatment plan. \ud83d\udd17 Epilepsy Foundation Resources \ud83d\udd0b Condition 12: Mitochondrial Disorders \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Mitochondria make energy in your cells. These disorders cause energy problems. Mitochondrial disorders are genetic conditions in which the cellular energy factories (mitochondria) do not work properly . Because mitochondria power every cell, these disorders can affect many parts of the body. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Low energy and muscle weakness: Frequent fatigue, muscle aches, or easy tiredness with exercise. Developmental delays: Many children have slowed development (motor skills, speech) or learning challenges. Neurological issues: Seizures, headaches, dizziness, or strokes can occur because the brain needs lots of energy. Organ problems: Heart (arrhythmias or muscle problems), vision/hearing loss, and digestive issues (poor growth, constipation or vomiting) are common. Metabolic signs: Low blood sugar or unusual blood/urine results (like high lactic acid) when tested. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Specialist evaluation: See a metabolic or genetic specialist. Diagnosis often involves blood tests (including lactate/pyruvate levels), genetic testing, and sometimes muscle biopsy. Genetic testing: Genetic testing of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA is a key tool for diagnosis. This can identify the specific gene mutation. Dietary support: Frequent small meals, sometimes a high-fat (ketogenic) diet, may be recommended to provide energy. Avoid fasting. Vitamin supplements (like B vitamins, CoQ10, carnitine) are often used under doctor\u2019s guidance. Manage symptoms: Treat seizures, diabetes, or heart issues according to standard care. Regular physiotherapy can help muscle weakness. Regular monitoring: Heart, vision, and kidney function should be checked regularly by specialists. Key Points: Mitochondrial disorders impair the body\u2019s energy production. This causes fatigue, muscle weakness, and can affect the brain and organs. Diagnosis requires specialist tests (often genetic). While there\u2019s no cure, therapies (like diet changes and supplements) and supportive care can improve quality of life. \ud83d\udd17 United Mitochondrial Disease Foundation \ud83e\udd38\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Condition 13: Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are inherited disorders of connective tissue (collagen), which give strength and elasticity to skin and joints. In simple terms, people with EDS often have very flexible joints and stretchy skin . \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Hyper-flexible joints: Joints can bend far beyond normal. This often leads to joint pain, sprains, or dislocations (e.g., elbows, knees, fingers hyperextending). Very stretchy, soft skin: The skin may stretch more than usual and feel velvety. Bruises or scars often appear because skin is fragile. A light pinch of skin may lift higher than normal. Slow wound healing: Cuts may take longer to heal and often leave thin, widened scars. Stitches might not hold well. Chronic pain and fatigue: Ongoing joint or muscle pain, easy fatigue due to unstable joints. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Medical diagnosis: Talk to a doctor (geneticist or rheumatologist). They may look for joint flexibility and skin changes and may order genetic tests. Protect joints: Use braces or tape for unstable joints. Engage in low-impact exercises (swimming, Pilates) to strengthen muscles without straining joints. Avoid contact sports or heavy lifting. Physical therapy: A PT can teach safe movement and exercises to support joints and posture. Skin care: Use gentle skin care. For wound care, medical attention is needed as stitches may pull through. Keep skin well-moisturized. Pain management: Medications (like pain relievers) or other therapies (massage, heat) can reduce chronic pain. Key Points: EDS causes extra-flexible joints and elastic, fragile skin. People with autism and EDS need extra care: braces for joints, gentle exercise, and careful skin protection. A genetics or connective-tissue specialist can diagnose EDS and recommend therapies to prevent injuries. \ud83d\udd17 The Ehlers-Danlos Society \ud83d\udcd6 Condition 14: Dyslexia \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Dyslexia is a learning disorder that makes reading difficult . It stems from how the brain processes language. Dyslexia is not related to intelligence ; many people with dyslexia are very bright but have trouble reading and spelling. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Difficulty sounding out words: Trouble \u201cdecoding\u201d \u2013 matching letters to sounds, so unfamiliar words are hard to pronounce. Reading errors: Skipping or misreading small words; reading slowly and below expected level. Spelling problems: Frequent spelling mistakes, even simple words, and inconsistent spelling. Avoiding reading tasks: May dislike or avoid reading or writing activities. Takes a very long time to complete reading or writing. Other clues: Trouble with rhymes or learning new words as a child; swapping similar-looking letters (like \u2018b\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019). \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Formal evaluation: If dyslexia is suspected, ask for a formal assessment by a psychologist or educational specialist. Schools often have resources for learning evaluations. Specialized instruction: Structured literacy programs (multi-sensory reading instruction) can improve reading skills. Tutors trained in dyslexia strategies can help. Accommodations: Extra time on tests, audiobooks, or text-to-speech software can assist. Using colored overlays or dyslexia-friendly fonts may help some readers. Practice and support: Regular practice with reading and phonics (sound-letter practice) is key. Encouragement and patience help build confidence. Key Points: Dyslexia means reading is unusually hard, but it isn\u2019t about being smart. Early help is crucial. With the right teaching methods and supports, people with dyslexia can become good readers and learners. \ud83d\udd17 International Dyslexia Association \u270d\ufe0f Condition 15: Dysgraphia \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Dysgraphia is a writing disability involving poor handwriting and difficulty expressing ideas on paper . It\u2019s not due to lack of effort; rather, the brain has trouble with the physical act of writing and sometimes with spelling. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Illegible handwriting: Writing that is hard to read, with inconsistent letter size or shape. Slow, painful writing: Writing takes an unusually long time or causes hand cramps. Spelling and grammar errors: Frequent spelling mistakes, even of simple words; trouble putting thoughts into written words. Messy work: Papers with erased mistakes, lots of scribbles, or mixing print and cursive. Avoidance: Frustration with writing tasks, avoiding writing or getting easily upset when asked to write. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Occupational therapy: An OT can teach fine motor skills (hand strengthening exercises) and handwriting techniques. Use technology: Allow typing on a computer, speech-to-text software, or recording answers orally for schoolwork. Writing aids: Special pencils/grips, lined or raised-line paper, and proper desk ergonomics can improve control. Educational support: At school, allow extra time for written assignments and consider giving oral tests if needed. Encourage dictation of ideas before writing. Practice: Regular short handwriting practice with multisensory methods (e.g. writing letters in sand) can help. Key Points: Dysgraphia means writing by hand is unusually difficult 52 . Tools like typing, occupational therapy, and accommodations (like extra time) can greatly help someone with dysgraphia succeed in school and daily tasks. \ud83d\udd17 Understood.org \u2013 Dysgraphia \ud83e\udd66 Condition 16: Nutritional Deficiencies \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Nutritional deficiencies occur when the body doesn\u2019t get enough vitamins or minerals from the diet. In autism, picky eating and restricted diets can increase this risk. Common deficiencies include low calcium (important for bones) and protein, as well as vitamins like D, A, or B12. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: General fatigue or weakness: Feeling very tired or lethargic (often from low iron or B12). Pale or pale skin: Anemia from iron or folate deficiency can cause paleness and breathlessness. Slow growth or weight issues: Not gaining weight or growing as expected in children. Bone/joint pain or fractures: Vitamin D or calcium deficiency can lead to weak bones. Frequent illness: Poor nutrition can weaken the immune system. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Balanced diet: Work with a doctor or dietitian to include a variety of foods. Even if it\u2019s hard, try one new food at a time. Foods rich in needed nutrients (dairy or fortified milk for calcium/Vit D, meat/beans for iron, colorful veggies for vitamins) should be included if possible. Supplements: A pediatrician may recommend a daily multivitamin or specific supplements (iron, vitamin D, etc.) if diet alone is insufficient. Do not take supplements without medical advice. Regular health check-ups: Doctors can monitor growth and ask about eating habits. Blood tests can check nutrient levels if deficiencies are suspected. Safe diet changes: If considering special diets (like gluten-free), consult a professional to avoid unintended deficiencies. Encourage gradual changes: Use strategies (described in Autism Speaks resources) to gently expand the diet. Involve child in meal prep or try sensory-friendly food textures. Key Points: Picky eating in autism can lead to not getting enough vitamins/minerals. If signs like fatigue or slow growth appear, talk to a doctor. A healthy, varied diet and, if needed, supplements can prevent deficiencies and keep the body strong. \ud83d\udd17 CDC \u2013 Micronutrient Facts \u2764\ufe0f Condition 17: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) \ud83d\udd0d What is it? Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a medical condition that affects the autonomic nervous system, which regulates various bodily functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and digestion. In POTS, the heart rate increases excessively upon standing, leading to symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Individuals with autism are at a higher risk of developing POTS due to differences in autonomic nervous system function and sensory processing. \ud83d\udc41\ufe0f How to recognize it: Rapid heart rate: An increase in heart rate of 30 beats per minute or more within 10 minutes of standing. Dizziness or lightheadedness: Feeling faint or disoriented when standing up or changing positions. Fatigue: Persistent tiredness or exhaustion, especially after standing or exerting oneself. Headaches: Frequent or severe headaches, often accompanied by nausea or vomiting. Nausea and vomiting: Stomach upset or vomiting, especially after eating or standing. Abdominal pain: Cramping or discomfort in the abdomen, often accompanied by changes in bowel movements. \ud83d\udccc Next steps: Medical evaluation: Consult a doctor to rule out other conditions that may be causing symptoms. A thorough medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests (such as electrocardiogram, blood tests, or tilt table test) can help diagnose POTS. Lifestyle modifications: Increase salt and fluid intake to help regulate blood volume and blood pressure. Avoid standing for long periods, and take regular breaks to rest and hydrate. Medications: Beta blockers, fludrocortisone, or midodrine may be prescribed to help regulate heart rate and blood pressure. Physical therapy: Gentle exercises, such as yoga or stretching, can help improve orthostatic tolerance and reduce symptoms. Dietary changes: Eat small, frequent meals to avoid postprandial orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Avoid triggers like caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. Autonomic nervous system training: Techniques like heart rate variability training, biofeedback, or meditation can help regulate the autonomic nervous system and reduce POTS symptoms. Key Points: POTS is a condition that affects the autonomic nervous system, leading to rapid heart rate, dizziness, and fatigue upon standing. Individuals with autism are at a higher risk of developing POTS. A comprehensive medical evaluation, lifestyle modifications, and medications can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. \ud83d\udd17 Dysautonomia International \u2013 POTS \u2705 Summary Box Condition Common in Autism?

Feel the weight of your body distributed evenly, and the connection to the earth beneath you. With each step, allow yourself to feel more grounded and centered. Focusing on the Breath As you walk, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the sensation of the air moving in and out of your body, and the rise and fall of your chest. Allow your breath to become slow and deep, and feel your body begin to calm. Releasing Anxiety and Stress Now, imagine that with each step, you are leaving behind any feelings of anxiety, stress, or overwhelm. Allow these feelings to drop away, like leaves falling from the trees. With each step, feel yourself becoming more calm, more centered, and more regulated. Feeling the Sun's Warmth As you continue to walk, notice the sensation of the sun on your skin. Feel its warmth and gentle touch, and allow it to soothe any areas of tension or discomfort. Imagine that the sun's warmth is filling your body, and helping you to feel more relaxed and at ease. Safety and Support Remember, you are safe and supported in this forest. Allow yourself to let go of any worries or concerns, and simply be present in this moment. Take a deep breath in, and feel your body fill with calm and relaxation. The Clearing As you come to a clearing, notice the sensation of the space around you. Feel the openness and freedom, and allow yourself to expand and relax. Imagine that you are a part of this forest, connected to the trees, the earth, and the sky. Conclusion Take a few more deep breaths, and allow yourself to settle into this feeling of calm and regulation. Remember that you can return to this forest whenever you need to, and that it will always be here to support and comfort you. Returning to the Present When you are ready, slowly begin to bring your attention back to your physical body. Notice the sensation of your feet touching the ground, and the feeling of the air on your skin. Take a deep breath in, and slowly open your eyes.

Why Gut Matters Many autistic adults experience gastrointestinal (GI) issues like constipation, bloating, or diarrhea. Taking care of your gut can improve comfort, focus, mood, and energy. Hydration: The First Step to Gut Health Why it matters: Water helps food move smoothly through your gut. Daily goal: Aim for 6-8 cups (or more if you are being active or feeling hot) Tips: Carry a water bottle. Flavor water with fruit or herbs. Try herbal teas or seltzer if plain water is hard to drink Fiber: For Regular Bowel Movements What it does: Helps prevent constipation and feeds good gut bacteria. Daily goal: 25-30g of fiber. Fiber-rich foods: Fruits (berries, pears, apples with skin) Vegetables (broccoli, carrots, leafy greens) Whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa) Beans, lentils, and seeds (chia, flaxseed) Go slow: Increase fiber gradually and drink more water. Healthy Fats: Calm the Gut & Brain Why they help: Support brain and gut function, reduce inflammation. Sources: Avocados Olive Oil Fatty Fish (salmon, sardines) Nuts & seeds (Walnuts, flax, chia) Magnesium: Soothing Mineral for Gut & Mood Why it helps: Can ease constipation, support relaxation, and reduce anxiety. Sources: Pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews Spinach, black beans Whole grains (brown rice, oatmeal) Supplements: Magnesium citrate is gentle on the stomach and may relieve constipation - check with Registered Dietitian or Doctor first. Vitamin C: Antioxidant & Gentle Support Why it helps: Supports the immune and may ease mild constipation. Sources: Oranges, strawberries, kiwi Bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli Supplements: Powders or chewables are easy options, ask your Registered Dietitian or Doctor about your best dose. Supplements to Consider for Gut Support Check with your healthcare provider before starting any supplement. These can be helpful for many autistic adults with sensitive GI systems: Probiotics What they do: Add \"good\" bacteria to support gut balance. Tips: Choose multi-strain formulas. Yogurt and kefir also contain live cultures. Aloe Vera Juice What it may help with: Mild constipation, gut inflammation, and soothing the digestive lining. Tip: Look for decolorized, purified aloe vera juice (without aloin). Start with a small amount (1-2 oz/day). Digestive Enzymes What they do: Help break down food more effectively and reduce bloating or discomfort. When to use: Take with meals, especially if you notice symptoms after eating certain foods (like dairy, gluten, or high-fat meals). Final Tips Routine helps: Try eating meals at the same time each day. Textures matter: Choose foods that feel comfortable to eat. Start small: Add one new habit at a time. Track symptoms: Keep a food and gut journal if helpful. When to Get Help If you're having ongoing stomach pain, constipation, or discomfort, talk to a doctor or registered dietitian for personalized support.
