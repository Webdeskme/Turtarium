        <h2>The Great Lift</h2>
        <p>The seaside town of Bellhorn thrums with life and legend. Overlooking the sparkling ocean, its proud stone walls and red-tiled rooftops shelter cobbled streets that echo with the songs of merchants, the clang of blacksmiths, and the laughter of children. At its heart lies the dolphin fountain, a beloved symbol said to bring luck to sailors and wisdom to dreamers. Towering above the town is the ancient Bellhorn Castle, its many turrets crowned with crimson pennants that flutter in the salty breeze. Bellhorn is known not only for its thriving fish markets and skilled shipwrights but also for its deep-rooted magical heritage—strange lights are sometimes seen over the water at night, and whispers of sea-spirits linger in the mist. With a soul as rich as its history, Bellhorn is a place where tales begin, and destinies unfold—especially for one young adventurer who calls it home.</p>
