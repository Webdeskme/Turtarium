			  "A sudden tug on your line nearly pulls you into the water. You manage to hold on and pull out... a chest encrusted with coral and barnacles. What’s inside?",
			  
			  "A fog rolls in while you’re fishing, and when it lifts, you’re no longer in the same place. Describe what you see and how you feel.",
			  
			  "As the sun sets, a song rises from beneath the waves. You follow the sound and see a mermaid sitting on the rocks. What does she say to you?",
			  
			  "You pull up a fish with golden eyes and a strange marking on its side. The marking looks like part of a map. What will you do?",
			  
			  "A stranger rows up beside your boat, offering you an ancient fishing hook. They say it only catches what your soul is searching for. What do you catch?",
			  
			  "Your fishing line snags something heavy. You pull and pull—until an old bottle emerges with a rolled parchment inside. What does the message say?",
			  
			  "You fall asleep while fishing and wake up to find your boat surrounded by glowing jellyfish. They're moving in a pattern—almost like they're guiding you. Where do they lead?",
			  
			  "As you're fishing, a storm suddenly forms—but only around your boat. Lightning crackles in a spiral above you. What or who is causing it?",
			  
			  "You catch a fish that speaks just one word before jumping back into the water. That word echoes in your mind. What is the word, and what does it mean?",
			  
			  "Your lure is taken and the water turns unusually still. A massive eye opens just beneath the surface. What do you do?",
			  
			  "A small, barnacle-covered statue of a sea creature comes up with your hook. As you hold it, memories not your own begin to surface. Whose memories are they?",
			  
			  "While fishing, you discover a second, smaller boat has tied itself to yours with no one aboard. Inside is a journal with entries that seem to describe your exact day… even events that haven’t happened yet.",
			  
			  "You pull up a fish made entirely of light, and as it fades, you’re left with a vision of a hidden place beneath the waves. What did you see?",
			  
			  "A pod of dolphins swims by and drops something at the side of your boat—a silver coin with an unknown symbol. What is its significance?",
			  
			  "You cast your line and feel a bite, but instead of pulling back, you get pulled under—into a world beneath the sea. What do you find there?",
			  
			  "A lighthouse in the distance flashes a strange rhythm while you're fishing. You realize it's Morse code. What message is it sending?",
			  
			  "You fish up an antique compass that spins wildly, then suddenly points to a direction that isn’t north. What lies that way?",
			  
			  "As you're fishing at night, a star falls from the sky and lands near your boat, sizzling on the surface of the water. What do you do with it?",
			  
			  "You reel in a message in a bottle addressed to someone with your name. The message is written in your own handwriting. What does it say?"
