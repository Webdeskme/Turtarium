  "You walk past your childhood home and someone unexpected opens the door. Who is it, and what do they say that stirs something in your heart?",
  
  "You help an old blacksmith whose tools are enchanted to hum lullabies. What do you learn from him—and what does the song remind you of?",
  
  "A fish market vendor claims to have caught a sea-spirit disguised as a fish. Is it a hoax, or something more? How do you respond?",
