			  "Dark storm clouds build on the horizon. You have only minutes before it hits. What thoughts go through your mind as the first drops fall?",
			  
			  "The sea is unusually warm, and the skies perfectly clear. Something about it feels unnatural. What do you sense beneath the surface?",
			  
			  "You spot a distant shipwreck half-submerged on a sandbar that shouldn't exist. What do you find when you explore it?",
			  
			  "A thick fog surrounds your vessel, and when it lifts, you see a massive, abandoned cruise ship drifting silently. What do you discover onboard?",
			  
			  "The ocean glows with bioluminescence at night, and your wake leaves streaks of light. Suddenly, the glow takes shape. What do you see?",
			  
			  "You find yourself caught in the eye of a massive hurricane, but it’s strangely calm in the center. What happens as you try to leave it?",
			  
			  "A floating message in a bottle bumps against your boat. The note inside is a warning from the past—or the future. What does it say?",
			  
			  "You're out of sight of land for days when a small wooden canoe appears beside you with a child inside, silently pointing west. What do you do?",
			  
			  "An albatross follows your boat for days without leaving. It begins to feel like a sign. What meaning do you attach to it?",
			  
			  "The sun rises in the west instead of the east today. You feel like something has shifted. What’s different now?",
			  
			  "A perfect rainbow arcs directly over your boat, and at its end floats a tiny island that wasn’t there before. What’s on the island?",
			  
			  "You wake to find your boat has been tethered to another while you slept. There's no one aboard the other vessel. What do you find inside?",
			  
			  "A deep rumble sounds from beneath your boat, like something ancient moving through the water. What do you do?",
			  
			  "A pod of whales surrounds your vessel, swimming in synchronized circles. Then one of them surfaces with an object on its back. What is it?",
			  
			  "You're becalmed for days—no wind, no current. As you drift, strange dreams begin to plague your sleep. What are the dreams, and what do they mean?",
			  
			  "Lightning strikes nearby, revealing a ghostly ship in the darkness. Each flash brings it closer. What happens when it reaches you?",
			  
			  "The ocean begins to rise, slowly but surely, higher than it should. You see waves towering on the horizon like a wall. What do you do?",
			  
			  "A perfect storm crashes around you, but your boat remains untouched. In the chaos, you glimpse a colossal sea creature guiding you. Why?",
			  
			  "You find a small floating crate tied with a red ribbon. Inside is something you’ve lost—something deeply personal. What is it, and how did it get here?",
			  
			  "Your radio crackles to life, broadcasting your own voice back to you—but from a time and place you don’t remember. What is it saying?",
			  
			  "You sail into an area where all your instruments fail, and the stars above are completely unfamiliar. Where are you?",
			  
			  "You drop anchor for rest, and in the morning, you’re moored to a floating garden filled with fruit trees and birds. Is it real?",
			  
			  "You’re approached by a sailor in a tiny boat who claims he's been at sea for a hundred years and offers you something. Do you take it?",
			  
			  "A flock of seabirds begins circling your boat, never landing or leaving. You count exactly fifty. What do they mean?",
			  
			  "You dive into the water to cool off and find an underwater staircase leading downward into darkness. Do you follow it?",
			  
			  "The sun never sets one day, and the light becomes almost too bright to bear. What effect does this have on you and the ocean?"
