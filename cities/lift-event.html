			  "You find a perfectly preserved room filled with digital diaries. One entry mentions someone with your name. What does it say?",
			  
			  "The Great Lift is powered by moonlight, but during an eclipse, something awakens. What changes in the city—and in you?",
			  
			  "Your reflection in the mirrored corridors moves on its own, mimicking your doubt instead of your actions. What does it try to show you?",
			  
			  "You discover a glowing, spherical archive that displays past lives of its users. Who among your group sees something shocking?",
			  
			  "One of your companions begins to hear a distant lullaby only they can hear. What does it mean—and how does it affect them?",
			  
			  "In a floating garden, you find a tree bearing holographic fruit. When you touch one, you relive a moment from your childhood. What is the memory, and why is it important now?",
			  
			  "The abandoned city is whisper-quiet, but at midnight, faint voices echo through its crystal halls. Who are they calling, and what language are they speaking?",
			  
			  "You find an artificial intelligence still functioning. It mistakes you for its original creator. Do you play along—or confront it with the truth?",
			  
			  "A forgotten elevator takes you deeper underground into The Great Lift's 'Core Sanctuary'. What's hidden there, and how does it reshape your purpose?",
			  
			  "Your group discovers a device labeled only ‘Emotive Relay’. When activated, it makes each person feel what another is feeling. What happens when your fears are no longer private?",
			  
			  "A recording shows The Great Lift’s final moments—panic, silence, and something dark approaching from space. What do you see that the others don’t?",
			  
			  "You find an observatory tuned to Earth’s oceans. It seems to be tracking the turtle cities. Why was the moon watching the sea?",
			  
			  "There is a sculpture garden on the edge of the city—each statue a person mid-scream, preserved in white stone. One of them looks like someone in your party. How do you respond?",
			  
			  "You enter a chamber called 'The Hall of Simulations'. Each person experiences a tailored illusion. What does yours show—and does it tempt you to stay?",
			  
			  "The gravity fluctuates wildly in one district, making everyone experience weightlessness and intense heaviness. What emotional truths does this strange environment reveal?",
			  
			  "You find the remnants of a lunar society that used music to communicate through light. You accidentally trigger a melody that reveals a secret path. What do you find?",
			  
			  "Each of your companions begins having dreams they can’t remember after waking—but one night, you remember all of them. What do they mean?",
			  
			  "A corridor of shifting walls forces the group to separate. What does your solo path reveal to you about yourself—and about someone you care for?",
			  
			  "At the heart of The Great Lift, you discover a message meant for you, written long before you were born. Who wrote it, and why?"
